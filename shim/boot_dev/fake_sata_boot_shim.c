/**
 * A crazy attempt to use SATA disks as proper boot devices on systems without SATA DOM support
 *
 * BACKGROUND
 * The syno-modifed SCSI driver (sd.c) contains support for so-called boot disks. It is a logical designation for drives
 * separated from normal data disks. Normally that designation is based on vendor & model of the drive. The native SATA
 * boot shim uses that fact to modify user-supplied drive to match that vendor-model and be considered bootable.
 * Likewise similar mechanism exists for USB boot media. Both are completely separate and work totally differently.
 * While both USB storage and SATA are SCSI-based systems they different in the ways devices are identified and pretty
 * much in almost everything else except the protocol.
 *
 *
 * HOW DOES IT WORK?
 * This shim performs a nearly surgical task of grabbing a SATA disk (similarly to native SATA boot shim) and modifying
 * its descriptors to look like a USB drive for a short while. The descriptors cannot be left in such state for too
 * long, and have to be reverted as soon as the disk type is determined by the "sd.c" driver. This is because other
 * processes actually need to read & probe the drive as a SATA one (as you cannot communicate with a SATA device like
 * you do with a USB stick).
 * In a birds-eye view the descriptors are modified just before the sd_probe() is called and removed when
 * ida_pre_get/ida_alloc_range() is called by the sd_probe(). The ida_pre_get/ida_alloc_range() is nearly guaranteed
 * [even if the sd.c code changes] to be called very early in the process as the ID allocation needs to be done for
 * anything else to use structures created within.
 *
 *
 * HERE BE DRAGONS
 * This code is highly experimental and may explode at any moment. We previously thought we cannot do anything with
 * SATA boot due to lack of kernel support for it (and userland method being broken now). This crazy idea actually
 * worked and after many tests on multiple platforms it seems to be stable. However, we advise against using it if USB
 * is an option. Code here has many safety cheks and safeguards but we will never consider it bullet-proof.
